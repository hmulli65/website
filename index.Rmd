## Filtering rows and columns

In sql you can filter rows by using WHERE and columns by using SELECT. Let's look at an example using the Lahman basebal database. First, we should load the Lahman package and the sqldf package. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Let's take a look at an example. If we want to see the homerun totals for the 1927 yankees. We could write:

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```
